po-small-electric-fuse=Small electric fuse
po-medium-electric-fuse=Medium electric fuse
po-big-electric-fuse=Big electric fuse
po-huge-electric-fuse=Huge electric fuse

po-nexelit-power-fuse=Nexelit fuse

[entity-description]
po-electric-fuse=Much more likely to explode when overloaded and has a lower maximum consumption than the corresponding electric pole.
po-transformer=Separates electric networks from each other.\nEfficiency can be changed in mod settings.
po-interface=Can handle near-infinite amounts of power but only to one machine.\nCan be rotated once placed.

[item-name]
po-hidden-electric-pole=Transformer connection

[item-description]
po-hidden-electric-pole=Dummy item for representing transformer connections in blueprints. Will be removed when the transformer is placed.\nConnections may look incorrect if the blueprint is rotated or flipped, but this will resolve itself when the transformer is placed.

[mod-setting-name]
power-overload-disconnect-different-poles=Automatically disconnect poles of different types
power-overload-on-pole-overload=When power pole is overloaded
power-overload-log-to-chat=Power pole explosion alerts in chat
power-overload-transformer-efficiency=Transformer efficiency
power-overload-entity=__ENTITY____1____

[string-mod-setting]
power-overload-on-pole-overload-destroy=Destroy
power-overload-on-pole-overload-damage=Damage
power-overload-on-pole-overload-fire=Catch fire
power-overload-on-pole-overload-nothing=Nothing

[mod-setting-description]
power-overload-disconnect-different-poles=Prevents accidentally connecting different networks that have different maximum consumptions.
power-overload-transformer-efficiency=How much energy is output for each unit input. 1 means all energy is transferred, 0 means no energy is transferred.

[string-mod-setting-description]
power-overload-on-pole-overload-nothing=Use temporarily when adding the mod to an existing save so that the necessary adjustments can be made first.

[overload-alert]
alert=[entity=__1__] destroyed (Consumption = __2__MW)
